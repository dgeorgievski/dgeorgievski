I am a DevOps Engineer wearing many hats. Full-stack development is one of my passions that makes me better of what I normally do. 

Love Kubernetes, event based and distributed systems. Lately I have been trying to learn about and apply my skills to Blockchains, the ultimate decentralized platform, and Web3.
